Hoos Home is a web application to connect students with housing options. On the home page, you can search housing based on keywords and number of beds and baths. 

In the top navbar:
* BUY - Allows you to view existing properties
* SELL - Allows you to create a new listing (must be signed-in)
* HELP – Takes you to instructions for the site
* LOGIN WITH GOOGLE – Go to the login page (Must use a virginia.edu email address)

On the listings page, you can look at the properties. At the top, there are a filter and sort toggle that allows you to do the respective action on the houses according to properties like price and rating. If you want a more detailed view for a specific property, you can click “contact property” to view more information on each property.

On the properties’ individual page, you can view its description, available amenities, realtor contact info, and location. Additionally, you can see reviews left by others and even leave your own. 

On the create listing page, you fill out all of the form data and upload three appropriate pictures to create a new listing.
